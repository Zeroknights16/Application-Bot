# FAQ

* **My bot doesnt start?**\
Make sure u have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. And then run the `install.bat` file. 
When all the node_modules are installed u can fill in the config.json file. When ur done with that run the `start.bat` file to start the bot.

* **I'm not sure how to setup the bot!**\
No Problem! Just message Zeroknights on Discord (Zeroknights#9457) and we'll figure it out! :D
